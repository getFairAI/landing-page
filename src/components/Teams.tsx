              We are a team of three software engineers with a passion for AI and technology. After
              working as consultants for three years, we pursued a master&apos;s degree in AI, which
              solidified our expertise in the field. We then decided to create FairAI, an
              open-source AI project, and quit our jobs to make it a reality. Our diverse skills and
              characteristics make us the perfect team for this project and contribute to the
              progress of open-source AI.
